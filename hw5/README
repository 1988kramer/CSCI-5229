Attributions:
 - This program borrows heavily from ex13.c. Supporting functions such as
   special(), reshape(), Print(), Sin(), Cos(), and Project() were lifted
   from ex13.c unchanged. The display function is slightly changed from 
   ex13.c in that the sphere and cube were replaced with my piper cub 
   model. Note also that CSCIx229.h has been changed slightly from the 
   version included with ex13; it now includes the drawPiperCub() function 
   from pipercub.c.

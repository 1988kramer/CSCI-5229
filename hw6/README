hw6: Textures

Andrew Kramer
CSCI5229 Fall 2018

Demonstrates the use of textures using the piper cub model
from homeworks 3 through 5. The user can rotate the model,
zoom in and out, and change the lighting properties. The user
can also select the texture used, making the airplane appear
to be covered with fabric, rivited aluminum, or bricks.

Attributions:
 - This program borrows heavily from ex15.c. Supporting functions such as
   special(), reshape(), Print(), Sin(), Cos(), and Project() were lifted
   from ex15.c unchanged. The display function is slightly changed from 
   ex13.c in that the sphere and cube were replaced with my piper cub 
   model.
